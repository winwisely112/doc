# Design




## Runtime Dependents

embed repo

- all of it.

- exposes a GRPC channel to the Flutter layer

plugins repo

- some of the plugins there.

packages repo

- some of the packages there.

- modules are higher level packages

## Devtime Tooling

Bootstrap repo

- stuff to get setup to do dev and code gen.


## Architecture

Architecturally its important to strive for abstractions to enable building apps on top.


IOC (Inversion of Control ), Dependency injection (DI) & Factory Patterns help sometimes so be aware of this.

Here is a DI example: https://github.com/jonsamwell/flutter_simple_dependency_injection

## Functionality

This has core things that all our apps need:

- i18n internationalisation

- Printing

- Responsive Master Details Layout

- Deep Linking and routing

- Help & Docs

- Nav & Settings



## I18n

The gsheet tool in the bootstrap repo is able to download the translations for all languages and convert them to JSON.

- We need to incorporate that with the Standard Flutter Arb file format and tooling.

- LTR / RTL support

- Settings - Select language

## Printing

See the Plugins repo for the dart plugin (https://github.com/DavBfr/dart_pdf) that supports PDF output and Printing support

It recently works for Web and Mobile and partially for Desktop ( not go-flutter desktop like we use)

## Responsive Master Details Layout

We need to support all screen sizes and orientations.

A common approach to this is to use the Master Detail Pattern.

There is an example here: https://github.com/roughike/adaptive-master-detail-layouts

It lacks:

- Back button
	- There must always be a back button and at the moment there is not.

## Deep Linking / Sharing & Routing

This is obvious.

Needs to work on Web, Desktop and Mobile.

Note a bad attempt:
https://github.com/Flutterando/modular
- Made an Issue about whats is missing for Sharing: https://github.com/Flutterando/modular/issues/15

## Help & Docs

This just needs to be a Markdown driven GUI.

The folders of the Markdown determines the Navigation of the GUI. One to One mapping.

The markdown lives in the assets - Later we can make it pulled from a Server.


## Nav & Settings

We prefer the Google Chrome Duet pattern, in which all Nav buttons are at the bottom of the Screen, so that its easy to reach from a Mobile.

- Apps
	- Opens a Drawer with all App links
- Home
	- obvious
- Search
	- Opens a Search screen. This will be a facet search system.
- Share
	- Every Screen can be shared because its really just a Route.
	- Mobiles have this button as part of the OS itself
- Print
	- Every screen that is Printable shows this.
	- Mobiles have this button as part of the OS itself
