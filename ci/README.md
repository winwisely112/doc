# Continuous Integration (CI) 

Continuous Integration is also important

GitHub Actions is used at the moment, but more work is needed for packaging and Signing.
Others are:
App Center (https://appcenter.ms/)
Azure Pipelines (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/?nav=min)

We use Golang to wrap all scripts so that they are cross platform,
so that the same code run on the local machine and in the CI Server.
More work is needed here also.

The Bootstrap repo has some of these but they are not finished.

- allows you to test on REAL devices in the AWS Deice Farm

Renamer
